# JavaScript Paint

A jQuery application that allows you to paint on the canvas, for all of us that grew up on Microsoft Paint

**Live demo:** [https://radtket.github.io/paint.js/](https://radtket.github.io/paint.js/)

## Getting started

### Clone repo

```bash
# clone the repo
$ git clone https://github.com/radtket/paint.js.git my-project

# go into app's directory
$ cd my-project

# install app's dependencies
$ npm install
```

## Usage

```bash
# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000.
$ npm run start

# build for production with minification
$ npm run build
```

## What's included

Within the download you'll find the following directories and files, logically grouping common assets and providing both compiled and minified variations. You'll see something like this:

```code
my-project/
├── docs/
├── src/
│   ├── favicon/
│   ├── img/
│   ├── js/
│   ├── scss/
│   ├── ...
